# Titanic-Data-Exploration
The purpose of this exercises is to show different data exploration tasks. I have executed Python code in Jupyter and used train.csv and train1.csv as reference data. 
In train.csv there is null data. so i used dropna() method and remove null data row from data set. And in train1.csv there is also null data but i used fillna() method and replace null values with specific values.  
I used pandas , matplotlib and seaborn library and different function. For more information about dataset like number of rows,number of columns , graphical representation and more data exploration, go through file Titanic-Data-Exploration.ipynb jupyter file.
